## Power BI Project: Hospitality Domain Dashboard

### Overview:
In this Power BI project, I utilized the Hospitality Domain dataset to develop a comprehensive dashboard showcasing key metrics and visualizations for business analysis. The dashboard provides actionable insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and profitability.

### Tools used:
- Power BI Desktop

### Visualization:
- **Data Overview:**
    - Revenue: The total revenue realized
    - RevPar(Revenue Per Available Room): Represents the revenue generated per available room, whether or not they are occupied.
    - DSRN(Daily Sellable Room Nights):Represents how many rooms on average are booked for a day considering a time period.
    - Occupency %: Represents total successful bookings happened to the 
total rooms available.
    - ADR(Average Daily Rate): Represents the ratio of revenue to the total rooms booked/sold. 
It is the measure of the average paid for rooms sold in a given time period.
    - Realisation: Represents succesful "checked out" percentage over all bookings happened.
- **Revenue Segmentation:**
    - Revenue by category (Donut Chart): Distribution of bookings revenue across different room segments.
- **Trend by Key Metrics:**
    - This chart allows you to see the overall weekly trend for metrics such as: RevPAR, ADR and Occupancy %.
- **Platform Performance:**
    - This chart helps you to see the Realisation % and ADR by different online platforms.
- **Key Metrics Table:**
    - Table that displays key metrics about each property in differnt cities
- **Filters:**
    - Data in this dashboard can be filtered by different cities, room types and by specific month or week
